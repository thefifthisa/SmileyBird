	  <h1>Final Project Proposal</h1>
	  <p>Change of plans: while I would love to recreate the closet computer (see below), I realized when I started working that this idea was a little too ambitious given the time frame of the final project. I now plan to <b>recreate Flappy Bird but controlled by the player's facial expressions</b>! There was a phase in high school when all my friends were hooked on this frustrating game. Inspired by our last class discussion on face tracking, I found a way to make it even more frustrating (but hopefully more fun too) ðŸ˜…</p>

	  <p><strike>I'm a big fan of romantic comedies and coordinating outfits, so my overarching idea is to create a <b>wardrobe app</b> inspired by Cher's closet computer in the movie <i>Clueless</i>.</p>

	  <p>I envision that the user can <b>mix and match pieces</b> from different categories in the curated wardrobe or choose <b>"auto-dress" mode</b> for a randomly generated outfit. They will then be able to <b>"try on" the clothes through an AR interface</b>â€”similar to this, but with a digital overlay of the outfit over the user in real time:</p>

	  <p>Aside from being able to recreate a fun idea from one of my favorite bits of pop culture, I want to do this project because <b>it involves technology and techniques I've never worked with before</b>: augmented reality, integrating with a webcam/phone camera, and tracking the user's body shape and movements to fit the outfit overlay. I think it would be another interesting challenge to implement the original closet computer's <b>"mismatch" feature</b> which flags outfits that aren't as well-coordinated, possibly by encoding which colors and styles match.</strike></p>
