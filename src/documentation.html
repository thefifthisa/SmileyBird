    <h1>Smiley Bird</h1>
    <h3>by Isabelle Lavandero<br />for Interactive Computing, Fall 2018</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Smiley Bird</b> is a web-based recreation of <i>Flappy Bird</i>, a game
      that took the mobile gaming world by storm back in 2014. I designed the
      interface with p5.js and also integrated the CLM face tracker so the
      player can control Flappy the Bird by smiling (or basically changing how
      wide their mouth is open).
    </p>

      The inspiration for this game came from a time in high school when my
      friends and I were all hooked on this frustrating game and would spend
      breaks in between classes trying to beat each other's high scores. Case in
      point, one of my best friends tweeted me this after I showed her a (very
      rough) demo of what I was making ðŸ˜…
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus, I thought it would be really fun to recreate the game for the web.
      Part of the reason I chose to work with CLM tracker instead of another
      augmented reality (AR) or motion tracking tool was also because you don't
      need any special hardware to play, just your computer's webcamâ€”kind of
      like how we only needed a smartphone to enjoy the original game.
    </p>

    <p>
      To tackle this project (especially since I was working alone), I started
      with breaking the components up into manageable pieces. I knew there would
      have to be start and end screens, and the actual game required a video to
      guide the player, Flappy herself, the moving pipes she has to pass
      through, as well as miscellaneous stuff that enhances the playing
      experience (for example, a scoring mechanism, lives counter, and even just
      a way to turn sounds off). I used the Face Tracking sample code from the
      last day of class to start the video from the player's webcam and create a
      guide tracking the different points of their lips. I then began building
      out the game interface by searching for pixel art assets for Flappy, the
      city background, and various icons. Before putting them in, I edited some
      of the colors using Pixel Art Maker to achieve a cohesive style to the
      game.
    </p>

    <p>
      Object-oriented programming came in handy so I could implement and test
      the functionalities of Flappy and the moving pipes in an orderly fashion.
      With the Flappy class, I mostly struggled with controlling the bird's
      vertical movement using the player's smile. At first, I had a console
      statement that printed out my mouth opening, calculated using the
      difference of my upper and lower lips from CLM tracker, in order to
      determine the minimum and maximum values. I then used the map function to
      translate that into a speed that was added to Flappy's y-position and made
      it move up or down accordingly. However, I found that the resulting
      movement was a little slow. I realized a better approach would be to map
      the mouth opening to an actual y-position based on the height of the
      canvas. It took me quite a bit of fine-tuning to map to a smaller range of
      y-positions that I manipulated afterwards to make the movement smooth but
      still with the characteristic jitter present in the original game.

      As for the Pipes class, my biggest challenge was figuring out when to add
      a new pipe. There was a point when my game always crashed upon starting; I
      initially thought it was because of the video or the transparency I was
      applying on certain assets, but later realized the crashes were caused by
      inadvertently adding so many pipes at once. To address this problem, I
      included checks to only add a new pipe if Flappy either passed or hit the
      current one.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once I got the main game working smoothly, it was easy to focus on
      improving other aspects. I animated the start and end screens, which seems
      like such a small thing but I've always wanted to implement a sort of
      typewriter effect that I saw in my classmates' midterm projects so I was
      really excited about this.

    <p>
      I also created calibration screens before the player enters the main game.
      After asking some friends to play, I realized that I only developed the
      face tracking to the size of my own smile! Thus, instead of hardcoding the
      values for the minimum and maximum mouth openings, I use the values
      gathered from the player's calibration.

      Overall, I'm really proud of this project! I love that this class taught
      me how insightful and straight-up fun it is to design art and games for
      the web, and I definitely want to continue building stuff like this in the
      future. <b><a href="../index.html">Hope you enjoy playing!</a></b>
